The application captures video frames from the webcam, processes them to detect hand landmarks, and overlays a virtual keyboard on the video feed. When the tip of the index finger touches a key, the corresponding character is registered. The typing speed can be adjusted through a configurable tap delay.

## Overview
The Gesture-Based Virtual Keyboard is an innovative project that enables users to type using hand gestures detected through a webcam. By integrating hand tracking with a virtual keyboard interface, this application allows for a seamless typing experience without the need for physical input devices.

## Key Features
- **Hand Tracking**: Utilizes MediaPipe for real-time detection of hand landmarks.
- **Virtual Keyboard**: Displays a fully functional keyboard on the screen.
- **Custom Input**: Supports letters, spaces, and backspace functionality.
- **Adjustable Typing Speed**: Configurable delay between key taps for a smoother experience.
